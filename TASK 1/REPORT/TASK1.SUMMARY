# üìù Task 1: Data Documentation & Quality Evaluation

## 1. Dataset Used
- **LibriSpeech Dataset** ‚Äì ~1,000 hours of English audiobook recordings  
- Components:  
  - **Audio files** (WAV/FLAC)  
  - **Text transcripts** (public-domain books)  
  - **Metadata** (speaker ID, gender, chapter, source book)  

## 2. Dataset Documentation
- Documented **available fields**: speaker ID, gender, transcript, audio path  
- Highlighted **missing fields**: age, accent/dialect, background environment  
- Created a **data card** including:  
  - Dataset description  
  - Intended use (benchmarking speech recognition)  
  - Sensitivity classification (voice data = restricted/confidential)  

## 3. Sensitive Data Labeling
- Classified each type of data:  
  - **Voice recordings** ‚Üí Restricted/Confidential (biometric data under GDPR/HIPAA)  
  - **Speaker metadata** ‚Üí Confidential (low risk but identifiable with voice)  
  - **Transcripts** ‚Üí Public (no personal info)  
- Applied data governance: encryption, anonymization, access control  

## 4. Data Quality Evaluation
Evaluated dataset quality across several dimensions:  

- **Completeness** ‚Üí Missing age, accent, environment metadata  
- **Consistency/Validity** ‚Üí Utterance duration distribution checked (most 8‚Äì15 sec)  
- **Representation/Fairness** ‚Üí Male and US/UK accent dominance; other demographics underrepresented  
- **Accuracy/Noise** ‚Üí Recordings are very clean, unlike noisy hospital settings  

**Visualizations created:**  
- Histogram of utterance durations (per dataset split)  
- Boxplot of loudness (dB) to check volume consistency  
- Waveform plots (clean vs noisy)  
- Spectrogram comparison (clean vs noisy)  

## 5. Improvements Implemented
- **Metadata Enrichment** ‚Üí Added synthetic fields (age, accent, environment) to metadata CSV  
- **Noise Simulation** ‚Üí Demonstrated adding background noise with Librosa to mimic hospital conditions  
- **Fairness Monitoring** ‚Üí Proposed checks across gender, age, and accents  
- **Segmentation & Concatenation Plan** ‚Üí To better match hospital utterance lengths  

## 6. Recommendations
1. Enrich metadata with demographics & environment  
2. Apply noise augmentation to simulate hospital conditions  
3. Collect & integrate real hospital dictations under GDPR/HIPAA  
4. Monitor fairness across demographic groups  
5. Encrypt and strictly control access to voice recordings

‚úÖ **Summary in One Line:** Task 1 documented the LibriSpeech dataset, labeled sensitive data, identified major quality issues (utterance length, bias, noise, missing metadata), and proposed practical improvements to make the dataset suitable for hospital speech recognition.
