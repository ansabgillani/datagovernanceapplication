Data Card: LibriSpeech Dataset

DATASET	DATASET SUMMARY
Librispeech 	LibriSpeech is a large-scale corpus of approximately 1,000 hours of English speech derived from audiobooks read from the LibriVox project. It contains high-quality 16kHz audio recordings paired with accurate transcriptions. The dataset is widely used for training and benchmarking automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. While it provides clean, standardized data for research, it is limited in diversity of accents, speaking styles, and lacks domain-specific content such as medical terminology.

DATASET OVERVIEW	
Data Subjects	Non-sensitive speech recordings from volunteer audiobook readers
Size of Dataset	~1,000 hours
, ~281,000 utterances
SENSITIVITY OF DATA	
Sensitivity Type	Biometric (voice) → Sensitive under GDPR
Fields with Sensitive Data	Speaker voice (audio).
Security & Privacy Handling	Public dataset, anonymized speakers
[In hospital context, must be treated as Confidential and protected with encryption, anonymization, and access controls.]
RISKS AND MITIGATIONS	
- Direct Risk
	Re-identification.
 Mitigation: Voice anonymization
- Indirect Risk 	Demographic bias. 
Mitigation: Complement with diverse datasets
-Residual Risk  	Identity traces after anonymization. Mitigation: Monitor and limit linkage
HUMAN AND SENSTIVE DATA	
Language	English
Risks	Demographic bias (majority US/European accents), exclusion of conversational speech
Mitigation	Use complementary corpora (e.g., Common Voice) for diversity, balance with accented speech data, apply fairness auditing
DATA QUALITY EVALUATION 	
Strengths	Clean audio, accurate transcripts, standardized benchmark dataset

Weaknesses	Limited accents, minimal background noise, no medical vocabulary
Recommendations	Supplement with hospital dictations, enrich metadata (age, accent), apply noise augmentation, ensure fairness monitoring
MOTIVATION AND INTENTIONS	
Purpose	Research & Benchmarking for ASR
Domains 	ASR, NLP, Speech-to-Text, ML, Benchmarking.
Factors 
	Addressed lack of large,
 open English ASR datasets; 
supported Kaldi community; 
encouraged reproducibility and comparability
INTENDED USE	
Suitable Use Cases	Benchmarking ASR systems, baseline training for speech recognition models.
Unsuitable Use Cases	Direct clinical deployment without adaptation; systems requiring diverse, noisy, or domain-specific speech data.

ACCESS, RETENTION AND WIPEOUT	
Access	Open access
Publicly downloadable from OpenSLR
Retention	No formal restrictions, but users must respect LibriVox license terms
Deletion/Wipeout	Users responsible for ensuring compliance if data combined with sensitive clinical data
VERSION AND MAINTENANCE	
Current Version 
	1.0 (Released 2015)
Maintenance Status 	Actively maintained on OpenSLR, no regular updates planned

KNOWN APPLICATIONS AND BENCHMARKS	
ML Applications 	ASR training, testing, fine-tuning
