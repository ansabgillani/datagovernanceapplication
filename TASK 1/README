Task 1 – Data Documentation & Quality Evaluation

This repository contains my work for Task 1 of the seminar project:  
evaluating and improving the LibriSpeech dataset for hospital speech recognition.

 Contents
- report/Task1_Summary– detailed summary of methods, findings, and recommendations  
- code/ – Python scripts for analysis and visualizations  
- results/– generated plots (waveforms, spectrograms, histograms)  

 Dataset
We used the [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12) dataset (~1000 hours of audiobook speech).  
Note:The dataset itself is not included here due to size and licensing.

Methods
- Documentation & Metadata: created a data card, added missing fields (age, accent, environment)  
- Sensitive Data Labeling: marked voice as Restricted, metadata as Confidential  
- Data Quality Checks: duration histograms, loudness boxplots, fairness analysis  
- Visualizations: waveforms & spectrograms (clean vs noisy)  
- Improvements: metadata enrichment, noise simulation, fairness monitoring  

 Example Results

[Waveform Comparison](results/clean_vs_noisy_waveform.png)

 Recommendations
1. Enrich metadata with demographics  
2. Add noise augmentation for hospital realism  
3. Collect & integrate hospital dictations  
4. Monitor fairness across demographics  
5. Encrypt and control access to voice recordings
