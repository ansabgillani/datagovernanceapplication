# Task 1 – Data Documentation & Quality Evaluation

This repository contains my work for **Task 1** of the seminar project:  
evaluating and improving the **LibriSpeech dataset** for hospital speech recognition.

## 📌 Contents
- `report/Task1_Summary.md` – detailed summary of methods, findings, and recommendations  
- `code/` – Python scripts for analysis and visualizations  
- `results/` – generated plots (waveforms, spectrograms, histograms)  

## 🗂️ Dataset
We used the [LibriSpeech](https://www.openslr.org/12) dataset (~1000 hours of audiobook speech).  
⚠️ **Note:** The dataset itself is **not included here** due to size and licensing.

## 🛠️ Methods
- **Documentation & Metadata**: created a data card, added missing fields (age, accent, environment)  
- **Sensitive Data Labeling**: marked voice as Restricted, metadata as Confidential  
- **Data Quality Checks**: duration histograms, loudness boxplots, fairness analysis  
- **Visualizations**: waveforms & spectrograms (clean vs noisy)  
- **Improvements**: metadata enrichment, noise simulation, fairness monitoring  

## 📊 Example Results

![Waveform Comparison](results/clean_vs_noisy_waveform.png)

## ✅ Recommendations
1. Enrich metadata with demographics  
2. Add noise augmentation for hospital realism  
3. Collect & integrate hospital dictations  
4. Monitor fairness across demographics  
5. Encrypt and control access to voice recordings
